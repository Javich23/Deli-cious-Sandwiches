If the user chooses to exit the application, it will play the bell sound again, as if exiting the store. 

## Order Menu
The order menu lets the user add Sandwiches, drinks and chips to the order. Then the user can checkout, 
and confirm the order before doing so, or cancel the order and go back to the main menu.
