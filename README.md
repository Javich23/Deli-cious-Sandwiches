# SandwichShop

Sandwich Shop is a console-based Java application that simulates the operation of a sandwich shop.
It provides a simple menu to users, and allows them to add items like sandwiches, drinks, and chips to their order.
After the user is done ordering, the details of their order, including a total price, is displayed. Receipts for orders are saved to a text file.


## Usage
When you run the Sandwich Shop program, you will be presented with a menu of options:

![SandwichShop1](https://github.com/Javich23/SandwichShop/assets/130024873/62eb6c7e-fc76-477c-8688-224cb6138f36)

You can enter the number associated with each option to perform that action. For
example, if you want to add a sandwich to your order, enter '1'.
Once you're done ordering, you can enter '4' to checkout.
Your order details, including total price, will be printed, and a receipt will be saved to a text file.
