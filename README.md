# SandwichShop
Sandwich Shop is a console-based Java application that simulates the operation of a sandwich shop.
It provides a simple menu to users, and allows them to add items like sandwiches, drinks, and chips to their order.
After the user is done ordering, the details of their order, including a total price, is displayed. Receipts for orders are saved to a text file.

## Overview
The project contains 20 classes, of which 9 are enumerated types, and 1 is an interface.

## Main Menu
The main menu at the beginning will first play a bell sound, as if the customer enters the store. 
Next it will display the following:

If the user chooses to exit the application, it will play the bell sound again, as if exiting the store. 

## Order Menu
The order menu lets the user add Sandwiches, drinks and chips to the order. Then the user can checkout, 
and confirm the order before doing so, or cancel the order and go back to the main menu.
